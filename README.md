```

## Features

### Core Proxy Testing
- Concurrent proxy checking using goroutines with configurable concurrency
- Support for HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies
- Automatic proxy type detection and validation
- Detailed timing and performance metrics
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON, working proxies only)

### Security Testing & Validation
- **SSRF Detection**: Tests access to cloud metadata services (AWS, GCP, Azure), internal networks (RFC 1918, RFC 6598, RFC 3927), and localhost variants
- **Host Header Injection**: Advanced testing with multiple injection vectors including X-Forwarded-Host, X-Real-IP, malformed headers, and HTTP/1.0 bypasses
- **Protocol Smuggling**: Detection of HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities using Content-Length/Transfer-Encoding conflicts
- **Internal Network Scanning**: Port scanning capabilities and DNS rebinding protection testing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive URL validation with security hardening against malicious inputs

### Advanced Features
- Proxy anonymity detection with IP comparison
- Cloud provider detection and classification
- Custom HTTP headers and User-Agent support
- Rate limiting with per-host or global controls
- Reverse DNS (rDNS) lookup for host headers
- Structured logging with multiple verbosity levels
- Graceful shutdown with signal handling
- Configurable timeouts and validation rules

## Configuration

The application uses a YAML configuration file (default: `config.yaml`) to define cloud provider settings and validation rules. The configuration includes:

- Cloud provider definitions and metadata service endpoints
- Default HTTP headers and User-Agent settings
- Response validation rules and content matching
- Advanced security check configurations (SSRF, host header injection, protocol smuggling)
- Internal network ranges and reserved IP blocks
- Rate limiting and timeout settings

Example configuration:
```yaml
cloud_providers:
  - name: AWS
    metadata_ips:
      - "169.254.169.254"
    internal_ranges:
      - "172.31.0.0/16"
      - "10.0.0.0/16"
    asns:
      - "16509"
      - "14618"
    org_names:
      - "AMAZON"
      - "AWS"
```

You can specify a custom configuration file using the `-config` flag.

## Usage

1. Create a text file containing your proxy list, one proxy per line. The format should be:
```
http://proxy1.example.com:8080
proxy2.example.com:3128
https://proxy3.example.com:8443
socks5://proxy4.example.com:1080
```

Note: The scheme (http://, https://, socks5://) is optional. If not provided, http:// will be used by default.

2. Run the proxy checker:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt
```

### Command Line Options
```
Core Options:
- -l: File containing proxy list (one per line) (required)
- -config: Path to configuration file (default: config/default.yaml)
- -c: Number of concurrent checks (overrides config)
- -t: Timeout in seconds (overrides config)
- -v: Enable verbose output
- -d: Enable debug mode (shows detailed request/response information)

Security Testing:
- -r: Use reverse DNS lookup for host headers
- Advanced security tests are configured via the YAML config file:
  * SSRF testing against internal networks and cloud metadata
  * Host header injection with multiple attack vectors
  * Protocol smuggling detection
  * DNS rebinding protection testing

Output Options:
- -o: Output results to text file (includes all details and summary)
- -j: Output results to JSON file (structured format for programmatic use)
- -wp: Output only working proxies to a text file (format: proxy - speed)
- -wpa: Output only working anonymous proxies to a text file (format: proxy - speed)
- -no-ui: Disable terminal UI (for automation/scripting)

Rate Limiting:
- -rate-limit: Enable rate limiting to prevent overwhelming target servers
- -rate-delay: Delay between requests (e.g. 500ms, 1s, 2s) (default: 1s)
- -rate-per-host: Apply rate limiting per host instead of globally (default: true)
```
### Example Commands

Basic check against default URL:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt
```

Check with increased concurrency and longer timeout:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -c 20 -t 15s
```

Enable comprehensive security testing with debug output:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -d -config security_config.yaml
```

Save results to text and JSON files:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -o results.txt -j results.json
```

Test with custom security configuration:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -config custom_config.yaml -d -t 20s
```

Run without UI for automation:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -no-ui -v -o results.txt
```

Maximum performance testing:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -c 50 -t 5s
```

Debug mode with specific URL and timeout:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -d -t 30s
```

Advanced security testing with custom output files:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -d -o security_results.txt -j security_results.json -t 25s -c 30
```

Check proxies and save working ones to a separate file:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -wp working_proxies.txt
```

Check proxies and save working anonymous ones to a separate file:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -wpa working_anonymous_proxies.txt
```

Check proxies with rate limiting to avoid IP bans:
```bash
./proxyhawk -l proxies.txt -rate-limit -rate-delay 2s
```
